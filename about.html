    <h1>About this Assignment</h1>
    <p> Things I have learnt during this assignment </p>
  </div>

  <h2>The special features</h2>
  <p> i have implement a large text area for user to seach the status input, user can enlarge their input area as they wish, also made the website look more visualy appealing. and each page user can navigate to other pages </p>

  <h2>Part I have trouble with</h2>
  <p> The most trick part for the assginment is post process php page and search status php page. when coding those two pages. i need constantly checking if the code is vaild or not. lucky my Atom IED can install some package to perform debugging,
    also PHP sand box is alos a great tool to check the syantax error.</p>

  <h2>Things I will do better next time</h2>
  <p>I have spend quite long time to debugging my code, next time i will increase my coding efficency, also would like to use some smart coding technique to make the code more efficent and tidy. moreover next time I would like to try
    from_validateion_required for my status posting form page as shown in <a href="https://tryphp.w3schools.com/showphp.php?filename=demo_form_validation_required"> https://tryphp.w3schools.com/showphp.php?filename=demo_form_validation_required</a>.
    it is quite smart as I don't need to validte my NOT NULL input in the poststatusprocess.php</p>

  <h2>Reference I used for this assginment</h2>
  <p> I have watched many youtube videos regarding PHP and mysql function and how to set up the database in Myphpadmin. php website for functions and sytanx explaintaion (e.g.the check date function <a
      href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.checkdate.php"> https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.checkdate.php </a>),
    w3schools.com (e.g. the php implode function <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_implode.asp"> https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_implode.asp</a>) and lecture vidoes and slides (i have gone over them many times).
    stackoverflow website etc </p>

  <h2>Things I have learnt while doing the assginment</h2>
  <p> I have learnt how to do forms with various input types, checkboxes, radio buttons, how to connect php to mysql servers, also how to validate user input requirement e.g. parttners and regular expression. also I have learnt that coding need to be
    practiced and attendtion to detail. On one occation I have spend hours on searchStatus.php. then i found out i have one typo within the mysql query code, this has caused the code will not run. one singel error cost me hours of work. So check my
    code line by line when coding may save me the time next time. </p>
